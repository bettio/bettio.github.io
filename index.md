title: Hey there, I'm Davide Bettio! 👋
---

I'm a developer from [Padova, Italy](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/45.3986/11.8309),
with a **passion for open source** and the
**[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)/[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)** ecosystem.
Currently **Head of Technology** at [SECO Mind (formerly Ispirata)](https://github.com/secomind),
where we build **[IoT solutions](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte)** with Elixir.

- ⚛ **Creator of [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM)**: a tiny VM that
runs Elixir/Erlang on microcontrollers and on other constrained targets.
- 🦁 Co-creator of [Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte), an open-source IoT platform
in Elixir.
- 🧪 Organizer of [Erlang, Elixir, Gleam and Friends FODEM Devroom](https://beam-fosdem.dev/).
- 🅺 Former KDE contributor (mostly around the early Plasma era).
- 🛠 **Into embedded systems** since 2003, and still tinkering with weird,
[low-level](https://github.com/bettio/FluxOS/) stuff just for fun.
- ⛰️Outside of coding, I enjoy making sourdough pizza and bread, plus hiking whenever I can.
- 🐈 Also, I have a soft spot for [pallas cats](manuls.md).
